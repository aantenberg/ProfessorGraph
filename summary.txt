ProfessorGraph:

Our project is a combination between implementation and empirical analysis. 
We scrape the penn course catalog to get a list of courses and then we 
create a graph where every professor is a node and there is an edge between
two professors if they have taught the same class. We then analyze this graph 
to find a variety of interesting information, such as the clustering 
average coefficient, the professor with the most betweenness centrality,
and the size of the largest connected component. For TAs to run our project,
please look in CoureCatalog.java lines 52-54. Uncomment the lines that set 
department suffixes to a list of only CIS, which will allow the program to 
run much faster (it takes a couple hours to scrape the data from penn course 
review). Additionally, this project requires an installation of ChromeDriver
that is compatible with your OS and specific chrome system, as well as the 
inclusion of the selenium drivers in the Java classpath (the steps for this
are different for each IDE). Selenium was necessary for this project as 
we need to wait for penn course review to load before accessing the HTML.
